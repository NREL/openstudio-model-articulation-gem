This will have variable number of arguments basd on the model pased in. Alternative is to either only allo w one group to be chosen at at time, or allow a comlex string that describes everything. Also need to see how to define shirting. There is an offset but it may be above and below and may not be equal. In Some cases a mid floor is halfway betwen floors which makes just copying the base surfaces as shading multiple times probemeatic, since there is overlap. It coudl be nice to stretch one surface over many stories. If I check for vertial adn orthogonal surface that may work fine. '
